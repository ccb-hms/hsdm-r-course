## Installing Docker

We will be installing Docker Desktop, a graphical application which provides useful additional functionality and ease of access for using Docker containers. 
You can go to the documentation for [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/), or go straight to the installation instructions for  [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
It is recommended for Linux users to instead install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (see below).

#### Notes for Windows Users

It is recommended to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) backend as opposed to the Hyper-V backend. 
WSL is official Microsoft software which lets you install a Linux distribution on your Windows machine. 
Installing WSL will also allow you to easily run other software designed for Linux systems and directly use Bash command-line tools. 

You can /install WSL by following [the instructions here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
Feel free to choose any of the possible distributions (we like Ubuntu).

#### Notes for Mac Users

You will need to know whether your Mac computer is using an Intel or Apple silicon processor.
You can follow the instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211814) to find this information. 

If you are on a newer Mac with an Apple silicon processor, you will most likely also need to change a setting in Docker Desktop:

![Setting for Apple Silicon](../img/docker-silicon-rosetta.png)

1. Click the settings button in the right side of the top bar.
2. Click on Features in development in the left sidebar.
3. Check the box for `Use Rosetta for x86/amd64 emulation on Apple Silicon`.


#### Notes for Linux Users

While Docker Desktop can be run on [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/), support is limited.
This is because the core Docker containerization software (now called Docker Engine) is originally designed for Linux systems, and Docker Desktop enables Windows and Mac users to easily interact with containers as Linux users are already able to with the original software. 
You can install Docker Engine by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/).
