Since this is the first rendered page, let's put a set of required packages used in the session and other files here to help prevent rendering errors. Note that these are not all packages used everywhere, but most of those used in session materials and other places we do not already use pacman within the materials. 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  rio,          # File import
  here,         # File locator
  skimr,        # get overview of data
  tidyverse,    # data management + ggplot2 graphics 
  gtsummary,    # summary statistics and tests
  janitor,      # adding totals and percents to tables
  scales,       # easily convert proportions to percents  
  flextable,     # converting tables to pretty images
